# 🤖 Sumo Robot (2023)

This project was part of my early exploration of robotics, focusing on competitive motion control, sensor calibration, and 3D modeling. I co-designed and assembled a Sumo Robot capable of detecting ring edges and pushing opponents within a competition arena. Through this project, I strengthened both my technical foundation and emotional connection to robotics.

## 🎯 Objective

To apply foundational robotics knowledge by designing and assembling a competitive Sumo Robot. This project introduced hands-on experience in:

- 3D modeling and dimensional planning
- Hardware placement and electronics integration
- Sensor-based edge detection and motion control
- Iterative refinement under real conditions

On a deeper level, this project helped me:

- Gain confidence working with real hardware  
- Strengthen my problem-solving skills during time and emotional pressure  
- Discover the early beginning of my passion for **computer vision**, sparked by seeing sensors act like “eyes”

## 🧩 Role and Contribution

I worked under the guidance of my teacher throughout this project. My contributions included:

- **Primary 3D Designer:** I created the initial Tinkercad 3D model for the robot chassis and component alignment.
- **Guided Electronics Assembly Attempts:** I tried to assemble motor and sensor wiring. During this time, I was preparing to leave Thailand for the United States, and the emotional and time pressure affected my ability to complete the wiring confidently. I took the robot home to continue trying, but returned it in the same condition.
- **Calibration & Testing Observation:** I participated in adjusting sensor detection distances and motor speeds during testing sessions.
- **Code Understanding:** The full, functional code was written and maintained by my teacher. I tuned small logic parameters (speed, thresholds, delays) with guidance.

Due to **tight time limitations** (only a few days before departure), the final improvements to the 3D model for fitting accuracy, the complete wiring, and the finalized working code were completed by my teacher — while retaining the core structure and layout of my original design.

I deeply value the patience, encouragement, and mentorship that guided this process.

## 🔧 Development Process

1. **3D Modeling:** Designed chassis and sensor placement in Tinkercad.  
2. **Fabrication:** Printed and prepared the structure for assembly.
3. **Assembly Attempts:** Connected motors, sensors, and power systems under guidance.
4. **Calibration & Tuning:** Observed adjustments to sensing thresholds and motor responses.
5. **Final Completion:** My teacher finalized wiring, fitting, and code integration due to time constraints.

## 🧠 Challenges and Solutions

| Challenge | Response |
|----------|----------|
| Ensuring accurate 3D fit for components | Refined design with teacher guidance near final stage |
| Understanding wiring logic | Learned through guided attempts and step-by-step explanation |
| Tuning sensor thresholds | Observed calibration sessions to understand real behavior |
| Emotional/time pressure before departure | Learned to ask for help and progress through steady steps |

## ✅ Outcome

The robot successfully **detected ring edges** and **applied pushing force** during operation.  
Its performance demonstrated both strengths and limitations, but this project marked a meaningful step toward confidence in building functional robotic systems.

## 💡 Reflection

**Technical:**  
Strengthened foundational skills in 3D modeling, sensor reasoning, motion control, and observing calibration techniques.

**Personal:**  
Learned patience, humility, and how to move with steadiness rather than pressure.

**Relational:**  
Recognized that engineering is collaborative — growth happens through support, guidance, and shared problem-solving.

**Vision:**  
This was the moment I first felt drawn to **computer vision** — imagining robots that perceive and connect with the world.

## 📌 Acknowledgment

The final assembly, wiring refinement, and complete functional code were developed by my teacher.  
I will update this README with his name to properly honor and thank him.
